Matplotlib created a temporary cache directory at /tmp/matplotlib-ekfm7c5r because the default path (/a/home/cc/students/csguests/itaytuviah/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
